Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars. Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while Scots developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of Somerset.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 616, "text": "Mercian"}], "question": "From what Old English dialect is the standard for of Modern English descended?", "id": "570a86c76d058f1900182f40"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 881, "text": "Somerset"}], "question": "What modern dialect is sometimes regarded as being similar to that of the historical Kingdom of Wessex?", "id": "570a86c76d058f1900182f42"}]}]}]}
