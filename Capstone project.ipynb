    "    Natural language processing has been a topic of conversation since Alan Turing first designed a test that would involve a judge conversing with both a human and a machine and telling which one is the machine and which is the human. A machine is said to “pass” the test if the judge cannot tell the two apart. For years, the task of building a machine that passes this test has been – and continues to be - a very difficult task for computers and their programmers to accomplish. The main difficulty is due to all of the various rules and vocabularies we apply almost innately in our everyday conversations. For example, some words mean different things in different contexts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tWe can evaluate how well our models perform using questions that have already been answered by humans, by comparing these answers to the answers our machine gives. We can then compare the words and sentence structure of the machine’s answer to that of the human’s. For example, we could give the machine a score of 1 every time it uses a word in its answer as the human does, perhaps with the caveat that it only gets the point for words that succeed another matching word (or are the first word in the sentence.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tHowever, there are many ways to build a program that can try to understand and speak human language. One of the earliest applications of machine learning for this problem involved question classification. Researchers realized as far back as 1992 that in order to answer a question, a machine needed to be able to understand the constraints placed on a question. To do this, Drs. Xin Li and Dan Roth proposed a hierarchical classifier that would classify a question. (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1072378).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\tThe problem, of course, with this approach is that each possible question needs to have a classification. Furthermore, since our machine learning classifier needs to understand how the type of question affects the answer, it needs to be trained to understand the types of words (e.g noun, adjective), the sentence structures, etc. For example, for the question, “How does the human heart work?” it needs to first understand how to answer a question on how anything works. Only then can it answer the question of how the human heart works. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    What I propose is that instead of concerning ourselves with how a question is classified or the types of words in the question, or its sentence structure, we can instead train a machine to answer a question by classifying the question in terms of how it would be answered. This allows us to train our program on questions for which we may not have defined a classification. For example, to answer a question from our SQuAD dataset, the program wouldn’t necessarily learn that a question is related to an article, but that it is related to another question and to the answer we’re looking for.\n"
